Files and instructions necessary to build a Google Action for the Google Home or Assistant that lets you control a web page

These are the files necessary to complete my tutorial on how to control a web page using Google Home. After completing the tutorial you will be able to tell Google Home what you want to see in the browser, and the website will be updated accordingly. Since this is a proof of concept, we will build a very simple website showing pictures of dogs. Once you have built a simple solution like this, you can easily extend the functionality to more complex webapps.
